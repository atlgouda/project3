## New Restaurant Tracker

## Inspiration
I always try to keep a running mental list of new restauraunts I want to try, so I decided to make a tracker of where to keep them, and the neighborhoods in which they are located.

## Overview
Once a user comes to site, they will get to a landing page with the title and an entry button.  From there they will come to a list of users who have already had their data loaded.  From here they have the option to:
* Create a new user
* View a user page that displays the new restaurants they select
* See the restaurant page
* Follow a link to the restaurant's website
* Delete user or restaurant
* Update restaurant info
* Create a new restaurant
